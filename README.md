# ArchLinux Tweak Tool (ATT)

A versatile and powerful tool for customizing Arch-based systems with ease!

## Compatibility

Originally designed and tested for ArcoLinux, ATT has broadened its scope to support other Arch-based systems. Here's a list of systems we aim to support:

| Distribution          | Website                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| ArcoLinux             | https://arcolinux.info        |
| Arch Linux (Vanilla)  | https://archlinux.org         |
| Alci                  | https://alci.online           |
| Carli                 | https://arcolinuxiso.com      |
| Ariser                | https://ariser.eu             |
| EndeavourOS           | https://endeavouros.com       |
| Garuda                | https://garudalinux.org       |
| Manjaro               | https://manjaro.org           |
| XeroLinux             | https://xerolinux.xyz         |
| Axyl                  | https://axyl-os.github.io     |
| RebornOS              | https://rebornos.org          |
| ArchCraft             | https://archcraft.io          |
| CachyOS               | https://cachyos.org           |
| Archman       		| https://archman.org/          |
| BigLinux      		| https://www.biglinux.com.br/  |
| Artix         		| https://artixlinux.org/       |
| ParchLinux       		| https://parchlinux.ir/        |

We face challenges not only in programming but also in understanding various distributions. As we gain expertise, we will continue to add support for more Arch-based systems.

## Unsupported Distros/Desktops

Currently, there are no specific distributions that ATT is incompatible with. We even have support for **Wayland (Hyprland/Sway, ...).**

## YouTube Playlist

We have an informative [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlloYVGq5pS5nvFc_LYRE82Gh3XWA6rVH) on YouTube that explains this project in detail.
