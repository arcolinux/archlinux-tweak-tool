# ArchLinux Tweak Tool
A simple tool to tweak just about anything on Arch based systems!


# Compability

This program was created for and tested on ArcoLinux, meaning it will work best on that system.
By renaming the tool from ArcoLinux Tweak Tool to ArchLinux Tweak Tool our aim is to broaden our scope.

At first we would like the tool to be working on these systems.

| Distro | Website |
|--------------|-----------|
| ArcoLinux | https://arcolinux.info |
| Arch Linux (Vanilla) | https://archlinux.org |
| Alci | https://alci.online |
| Carli | https://arcolinuxiso.com |
| Ariser | https://ariser.eu |
| EndeavourOS | https://endeavouros.com |
| Garuda Linux | https://garudalinux.org |
| Manjaro | https://manjaro.org |
| XeroLinux | https://xerolinux.xyz |
| ArchLinux GUI (ALG) | https://archlinuxgui.in |
| Axyl | https://axyl-os.github.io |
| RebornOS | https://rebornos.org |
| AmOS | https://github.com/amanre |
| ArchCraft | https://archcraft.io |
CachyOS | https://cachyos.org |

The challenge for us is the programming but also the learning factor of other distros like EndeavourOS and Garuda. At a later stage when we get the hang of it we can add one Arch based distro at a time.
